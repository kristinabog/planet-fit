3. You will now find a copy of the original in your account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and navigate yourself to the repository.
2. Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone in the CLI and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
   It should look like this:
